Currently we have:

with tf.variable_scope(""bert"", scope)

Based on https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/variable_scope, it looks like, as-is, ""bert"" will always be used as scope, and 'scope' will never be used.

Swapping the two makes it so default_name=""bert"", as intended.  (The dangers of not assigning vars by name in python?)
