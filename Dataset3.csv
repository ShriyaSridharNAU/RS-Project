18,49145937.0,Fix for a ThreadSafety issue in ItemPropValue,"When multiple HTML documents are parsed concurrently in different threads, the MicrodataParser will sometimes throw very weird Exceptions or deliver broken values of date properties. I tracked it to a static SimpleDateFormat field in ItemPropValue. SimpleDateFormat is not thread-safe and should never be used like this. 

I wrote a unit test that tries to parse the same document in 10 concurrent threads about 100 times each. Then it gets a value of the ""birthday"" property. In all thousand cases the value should be the same. On my machine this test fails each time with various errors. With the fix - the test passes each time. 

The test uses a cyclic barrier and ensures that only in-memory data is used, so that I/O overhead and thread creation overhead do not interfere with the actual processing under test.

This is an initial crack at addressing https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ANY23-280
Essentially, the main API difference is the complete removal of `public interface ContentExtractor extends Extractor<InputStream>` from the Extractor interface in the api module.
This patch has a long way to go with numerous failing tests however I wanted to post it for feedback.
Although Any23 still builds with -DskipTests, without that flag the failing tests are as follows

These all have to do with the RDFa implementation failing to parse HTML.

My previous PR (#58) attempted to fix these issues by changing the default parser from NekoHTML to Jsoup. But alas, it turns out the RDFa implementation is using a completely different html parser under the hood, and it's the RDFa parser that's too strict, not ours, so changing ours from NekoHTML to Jsoup had no effect (although it did come with a nice 20% speed increase, so there's that). It seems that, for rio parsers, the input stream is parsed with Jsoup *only to get the document language* and then parsed **again** under the hood with who knows what.

Now, I simply check the RDF format to see if we're putting out XHTML. If we are, I first XHTML-ify the stream with Jsoup before sending it on to the rio RDF parser.

Having the statement:

Before using the default RDF4J writer:
```json

Now, using the RDF4J writer:
```json

        ""@id"": ""http://sub/1"",
        ""http://pred/1"": [

I am wondering about name conventions and some drawback compatibility. 
- Should we rename the classes `JSONWriter` to `JSONLDWriter` and `JSONWriterFactory` to `JSONLDWriterFactory`. 
- When using the REST API, should we use `jsonld` as output format  instead of `json`.

120,215637884.0,ANY23-396 Overhaul WriterFactory API,"Here is one possible alternative to the existing PR for ANY23-396.

**Pros:**

1. Fully backwards compatible
2. Extends `WriterFactory` with new `DelegatingWriterFactory` interface, which, rather than writing a `TripleHandler` to an output stream, writes a `TripleHandler` to another `TripleHandler`. This will allow users to produce a final domain-specific RDF graph of their choosing in Rover by implementing mapping/filtering `DelegatingWriterFactory` implementations. 
3. the `--format` flag in rover now represents a list of WriterFactory ids, rather than a single WriterFactory id. Each id in the list is composed with the one previous to it to construct the final `TripleHandler`. All writer factories in the list, except the last, are required to implement `DelegatingWriterFactory`.

**Cons:** 
1. this solution requires deprecating 3 methods in the `WriterFactory` interface (and then un-deprecating them in the extending `FormatWriterFactory` interface.) However, this drawback does not affect backwards compatibility. 

## ALTERNATIVE

In order to avoid the single ""con"" I have listed, the alternative to this solution would be, rather than extending the `WriterFactory` interface with `DelegatingWriterFactory`, to keep these two interfaces completely separate and define a new `DelegatingWriterFactoryRegistry` (analogous to the `WriterFactoryRegistry`) with a different `ServiceLoader` in order to load `DelegatingWriterFactory` implementations.

This is a security fix for a  vulnerability in your [Apache Maven](https://maven.apache.org/) `pom.xml` file(s).

The build files indicate that this project is resolving dependencies over HTTP instead of HTTPS.
This leaves your build vulnerable to allowing a [Man in the Middle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Man-in-the-middle_attack) (MITM) attackers to execute arbitrary code on your or your computer or CI/CD system.

This vulnerability has a CVSS v3.0 Base Score of [8.1/10](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

[POC code](https://max.computer/blog/how-to-take-over-the-computer-of-any-java-or-clojure-or-scala-developer/) has existed since 2014 to maliciously compromise a JAR file in-flight.
MITM attacks against HTTP are [increasingly common](https://security.stackexchange.com/a/12050), for example [Comcast is known to have done it to their own users](https://thenextweb.com/insights/2017/12/11/comcast-continues-to-inject-its-own-code-into-websites-you-visit/#).

This contribution is a part of a submission to the [GitHub Security Lab](https://securitylab.github.com/) Bug Bounty program.

## Detecting this and Future Vulnerabilities

This vulnerability was automatically detected by [LGTM.com](https://lgtm.com) using this [CodeQL Query](https://lgtm.com/rules/1511115648721/).

<p>jsoup changelog</p>
<p>*** Release 1.14.3 [PENDING]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improvement: added support in CharacterReader to track newlines, so that parse errors can be reported more
intuitively.
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1624"">jhy/jsoup#1624</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvement: tracked parse errors now have more details, including the erroneous token, to help clarify the errors.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugfix: when tracking errors or checking for validity in the Cleaner, errors were incorrectly raised for missing
optional closing tags.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugfix: the OSGi bundle meta-data incorrectly set a version on the import of java.annotation (used as a build-time
dependency for nullability assertions).
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1616"">jhy/jsoup#1616</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Build Improvement: fixed nullability annotations for Node.equals(other) and other equals methods.
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1628"">jhy/jsoup#1628</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>*** Release 1.14.2 [2021-Aug-15]</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Improvement: support Pattern.quote \Q and \E escapes in the selector regex matchers.
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/pull/1536"">jhy/jsoup#1536</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Improvement: Element.absUrl() now supports tel: URLs, and other URLs that are already absolute but that Java does
not have input stream handlers for.
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1610"">jhy/jsoup#1610</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugfix: when serializing output, escape characters that are in the &lt; 0x20 range. This improves XML output
compatibility, and makes HTML output with these characters easier to read (as they're otherwise invisible).
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1556"">jhy/jsoup#1556</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugfix: the *|el wildcard namespace selector now also matches elements with no namespace.
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1565"">jhy/jsoup#1565</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugfix: corrected a potential case of the parser input stream not being closed immediately on a read exception.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugfix: when making a HTTP POST, if the request write fails, make sure the connection is immediately cleaned up.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugfix: in the XML parser, XML processing instructions without attributes would be serialized as if they did.
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/770"">jhy/jsoup#770</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugfix: updated the HtmlTreeParser resetInsertionMode to the current spec for supported elements.
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1491"">jhy/jsoup#1491</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugfix: fixed an NPE when parsing fragment HTML into a standalone table element.
<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/jhy/jsoup/issues/1603"">jhy/jsoup#1603</a></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bugfix: fixed an NPE when parsing fragment heading HTML into a standalone p element.

<h3>[Pull request <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1687"">#1687</a>:](<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1687"">junit-team/junit#1687</a>) Mark ThreadGroups created by FailOnTimeout as daemon groups</h3>
<p>In JUnit 4.13 ([pull request <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1517"">#1517</a>](<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/pull/1517"">junit-team/junit4#1517</a>)) an attempt was
made to fix leakage of the <code>ThreadGroup</code> instances created when a test is run with a timeout. That
change explicitly destroyed the <code>ThreadGroup</code> that was created for the time-limited test. Numerous
people reported problems that were caused by explicitly destroying the <code>ThreadGroup</code>.</p>
<p>In this change, the code was updated to call  <code>ThreadGroup.setDaemon(true)</code> instead of destroying the
ThreadGroup.</p>
<h3><a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1691"">Pull request $1691:</a> Only create ThreadGroups if FailOnTimeout.lookForStuckThread is true.</h3>
<p>In JUnit 4.12 ([pull request <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/742"">#742</a>](<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/pull/742"">junit-team/junit4#742</a>)) the <code>Timeout</code>
Rule was updated to optionally display the stacktrace of the thread that appears to be stuck
(enabled on an opt-in basis by passing <code>true</code> to <code>Timeout.Builder.lookForStuckThread(boolean)</code>).
When that change was made, time-limited tests were changed to start the new thread in a new
<code>ThreadGroup</code>, even if the test did not call <code>lookForStuckThread()</code>. This subtle change in
behavior resulted in visible behavior changes to some tests (for example, tests of code that uses
<code>java.beans.ThreadGroupContext</code>).</p>
<p>In this change, the code is updated to only create a new <code>ThreadGroup</code> if the caller calls
<code>Timeout.Builder.lookForStuckThread(true)</code>. Tests with timeouts that do not make this call will
behave as they did in JUnit 4.11 (and more similar to tests that do not have a timeout). This
unfortunately could result in visible changes of tests written or updated since the 4.12
release. If this change adversely affects your tests, you can create the <code>Timeout</code> rule via the
builder and call <code>Timeout.Builder.lookForStuckThread(true)</code>.</p>
<h1>Exceptions</h1>
<h3>[Pull request <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1654"">#1654</a>:](<a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit/pull/1654"">junit-team/junit#1654</a>) Fix for issue <a href=""https://github-redirect.dependabot.com/junit-team/junit4/issues/1192"">#1192</a>: NotSerializableException with AssumptionViolatedException</h3>
<p>This change fixes an issue where <code>AssumptionViolatedException</code> instances could not be serialized
if they were created with a constructor that takes in an <code>org.hamcrest.Matcher</code> instance (these
constructors are used if you use one of the <code>assumeThat()</code> methods in <code>org.junit.Assume</code>).</p>

<pre><code>          Apache Commons Codec 1.15 RELEASE NOTES
          September 1 2020
</code></pre>
<p>The Apache Commons Codec package contains simple encoder and decoders for
various formats such as Base64 and Hexadecimal.  In addition to these
widely used encoders and decoders, the codec package also maintains a
collection of phonetic encoding utilities.</p>
<p>Feature and fix release.</p>
<p>Changes in this version include:</p>
<p>New features:
o CODEC-290:  Base16Codec and Base16Input/OutputStream. Thanks to Adam Retter.
o CODEC-291:  Hex encode/decode with existing arrays. Thanks to Adam Retter.</p>
<p>Fixed Bugs:
o CODEC-264:  MurmurHash3: Ensure hash128 maintains the sign extension bug.
Thanks to Andy Seaborne.</p>
<p>Changes:
o CODEC-280:  Base32/Base64/BCodec: Added strict decoding property to control
handling of trailing bits. Default lenient mode discards them
without error. Strict mode raise an exception.
o CODEC-289:  Base32/Base64 Input/OutputStream: Added strict decoding property
to control handling of trailing bits. Default lenient mode
discards them without error. Strict mode raise an exception.
o             Update tests from JUnit 4.12 to 4.13. Thanks to Gary Gregory.

<blockquote>
<h2>Spotbugs Maven Plugin 4.2.0</h2>
<ul>
<li>Revert and adjust changes from 4.1.3 regarding resource resolution.  A regression was caused in attempt to get rid of underlying deeply nested path for add-on plugins such as sb-contrib (fb-contrib).  Prior logic restored and support for windows based path added.  The underlying jars still get copied to target after this but no longer deeply nested.  A separate ticket is open to look at figuring out how to remove those from creation.</li>
<li>Replace deprecated groovy toInteger with as Integer</li>
<li>Support spotbugs 4.2.0</li>
</ul>
<p>Build changes</p>
<ul>
<li>Replaced travis-ci with github actions.</li>
<li>Supporting build on windows / macos now in addition to ubuntu.</li>
