Using the backface-visibility property causes 2D elements and transforms
to be elevated to a 3D context. Since the only transform being used is
rotate(Xdeg), which is a 2D transform, there is no need to incur the
extra performance penalty.

28,77131326.0,Update all dependencies 🌴,"Hello lovely humans,

**welcome to automated dependency management with [Greenkeeper](https://greenkeeper.io)**.
To take full advantage of this service I recommend to start out with up-to-date dependencies.

I just **updated all the dependencies in the `package.json`** file in one go.
Please look into these changes and make sure your project still works with them applied.
If you can’t update everything right now that’s fine as well.
We’ll get there over time.

Now that you told me to monitor this project **I’ll create a branch for every dependency update**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version. Using the results of these tests I’ll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

``` diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

In the above example you can see an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When there is a failure reported for the update I’ll create a pull request so you know about the problem immediately. When it reports success I’ll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.

This way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you’ll get to know of potential problems immediately :sparkles:

``` diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example the new version `4.0.0` is not included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request right away.

Now **you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand** – I’ll just let you know automatically.
And the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update. In case it passes your decent test suite that’s a strong reason to merge right away :shipit:

Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and of course you may always [ask my humans](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project and see you soon :sparkles:

:palm_tree:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of awesome-typescript-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ts-node.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

As lodash is a direct dependency of this project **this is very likely breaking your project right now**. If other packages depend on you it’s very likely also breaking them.
I recommend you give this issue a very high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

[GitHub Release](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases/tag/v2.2.0)

<h2>New Build System</h2>


<p>Starting with v2.2.0-rc.1 Chart.js uses a new build system. We no longer include the checked in files (dist folder) in the repository. When a tagged release is made, a build will occur and will be published on NPM automatically. A huge thanks to <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/simonbrunel"" class=""user-mention"">@simonbrunel</a> for getting this set up and working. </p>


<p>This change means that installing via bower needs to use the <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/mjeanroy/bower-npm-resolver"">bower npm resolver</a>. Detailed instructions can be found in the <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/master/docs/00-Getting-Started.md#bower"">docs</a></p>


<h2>Enhancements</h2>


<ul>
<li>New build system <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/chartjs/Chart.js/pull/2555"" class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-url=""https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/2555"" data-id=""154878414"" data-error-text=""Failed to load issue title"" data-permission-text=""Issue title is private"">#2555</a> </li>
<li>Adds a new tooltip and hover mode that replicates the <code>label</code> mode of Chart.js V1. <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/2299"" class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-url=""https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/issues/2299"" data-id=""149474280"" data-error-text=""Failed to load issue title"" data-permission-text=""Issue title is private"">#2299</a> Thanks <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/Mesonyx"" class=""user-mention"">@Mesonyx</a> </li>

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-uploader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ts-node.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of parse5.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ts-node.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

In reference to this issue: akveo/ng2-admin#162

You said you need to test to be sure that's work.

In my branch, I removed all traces of Bower and installed Ionicons from NPM. I used this [package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ionicons) which is maintened by the same author than [Ionicons](https://github.com/driftyco/ionicons).

The versions match and the last version is a pre-version of Ionicons v3. I used the same version than Bower which is **2.0.1**.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

- **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**
  Pages children routes definition with parameter support are working
  Additionally, it is possible to define route children without showing them in the sidebar
- **Other information**:

Adding the boolean parameter ""dontShowChildren"" to a pages route, it won't be shown in the sidebar. 
This makes possible children routes definition with parameter support, that previously wasn't working.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As bootstrap-loader is a direct dependency of this project **this is very likely breaking your project right now**. If other packages depend on you it’s very likely also breaking them.
I recommend you give this issue a very high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-smart-table.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As ng2-smart-table is a direct dependency of this project **this is very likely breaking your project right now**. If other packages depend on you it’s very likely also breaking them.
I recommend you give this issue a very high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of parse5.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As ng2-ckeditor is a direct dependency of this project **this is very likely breaking your project right now**. If other packages depend on you it’s very likely also breaking them.
I recommend you give this issue a very high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:

Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

87,83643788.0,Fix an issue about the font-awesome-sass-loader.,"Hi,

With the last current version, I get this error:

```
ERROR in ./~/font-awesome-sass-loader/index.js
Module not found: Error: Can't resolve './font-awesome-sass-styles' in 'node_modules/font-awesome-sass-loader'
 @ ./~/font-awesome-sass-loader/index.js 1:0-82
 @ ./src/vendor.browser.ts
 @ multi vendor
```

After research, it's a bug of the package `font-awesome-sass-loader` fixed in the [version 1.0.2](https://github.com/francisbesset/font-awesome-sass-loader/compare/v1.0.1...v1.0.2).

To avoid this kind of problem, I changed the minimal version of the package.

I couldn't build the production project, I get this error which seems unrelated to `font-awesome-sass-loader` package:

```
Error in bail mode: [default] src/app/pages/editors/components/ckeditor/ckeditor.component.ts:2:8

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-smart-table.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-uploader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-smart-table.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

99,84133945.0,Update ng2-smart-table to fix an issue related to module.,"Hi,

In using the master branch, I found issues about SmartTable and module introduced by Angular 2.rc5. I tried to update the package [ng2-smart-table](https://github.com/akveo/ng2-smart-table) and the issue is gone. However, I updated to the version 0.2.3 but it doesn't exist on the repo of the project.

Thanks.

100,84216582.0,Rudimentary support for electron,"- **What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (Bug fix, feature, docs update, ...)
  Based on #96, and because I want to use this wonderful project as the basis for a new electron app, I implemented a rudimentary wrapper for electron as a POC. I will extend this functionality on the electron part to include packaging, optimizations (removing polyfills etc.) later on.
  I would suggest creating a feature branch for this, so it can mature further before becoming an integral part of ng2-admin.
- **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)
  ng2-admin runs as a web application.
- **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**
  ng2-admin can now also be run as an electron app.
- **Other information**:
  The only change to ng2-admin itself is changing the base href from '/' to './', as electron uses absolute file paths. This change does not affect the normal behavior of the web application.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-bootstrap.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-smart-table.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

  I've done some testing. I removed all children from the _UI Features_ menu item and it worked as intended - the element was highlighted when I accessed that route's children (/buttons, /grid, /typography).

As for the second change I mentioned in the issue, it isn't needed since RC5, as then you guys split routing and menu apart and now you can just remove children from _pages.menu.ts_, so no need for filtering.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of chart.js.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of fullcalendar.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of leaflet.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-bootstrap.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

[GitHub Release](https://github.com/kevlened/copy-webpack-plugin/releases/tag/v4.0.0)

<p>This is a rewrite to add several new features.</p>


<h3>Features</h3>


<ul>
<li>Debug mode can be enabled with 3 options: <code>warning</code> (default), <code>info</code>, or <code>debug</code>.</li>
<li>Transform method can modify the contents of a file before writing it.</li>
<li>Warn on missing file or directory. Use the <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/webpack/docs/wiki/list-of-plugins#noerrorsplugin"">NoErrorsPlugin</a> if you want this to fail the build.</li>
<li>Allow name templates in <code>to</code> paths, like webpack's <a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/webpack/file-loader"">file-loader</a>.</li>
<li>Improved performance by reading files concurrently. Before, we used Bluebird's <code>each()</code> to process files, now we use <code>map()</code>. The <code>concurrency</code> option is exposed if you'd like to override the default of 100 parallel files.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Bug fixes</h3>


<ul>
<li>Allow graceful-fs to patch EMFILE/ENFILE issues. <code>fs.readFileSync</code> isn't used to load file contents into webpack's compilation.assets anymore.</li>
<li>Handle edge case for webpack-dev-server where absolute <code>to</code> couldn't be written.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Breaking changes</h3>


<ul>
<li>Ignore globs also ignore dotted files by default.</li>
</ul>

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-bootstrap.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of typescript.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

Added feature for Toast-like notifications (I saw it was requested on #50 )


* **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)
Added service for Toast-like notifications based on https://github.com/kamranahmedse/jquery-toast-plugin/ . I chose this plugin because it seemed nice, modern looking and jQuery was already a project dependency.

* **Other information**:
The service was added under `/src/app/theme/services/baToastNotification`

* **How to use it**

1. Import the service
`import { BaToastNotificationService } from '../../../../theme/services/baToastNotification'`
2. Inject service
`constructor(private _toast:BaToastNotificationService){}`
3. Set toast default settings
```javascript
this._toast.setToastDefaults({
    text: """",

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of typescript.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

[GitHub Release](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases/tag/v2.4.0)

<p>This version focuses on improving the interactivity of Chart.js. We have new and improved modes for interacting with the graph. For instance, you can now highlight the nearest item easily. It is also easy to define your own tooltip modes with a few simple functions. See all the new modes in the <a href=""/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/v2.4.0/chartjs/Chart.js/blob/master/docs/01-Chart-Configuration.md#interaction-modes"">docs</a>. Data animations when adding and removing data have been improved: points now animate in cleanly by default.</p>

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of copy-webpack-plugin.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of gh-pages.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of tslint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of zone.js.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of tslint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of tslint-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of css-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of parse5.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-uploader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of rxjs.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

234,98444288.0,feat(sidebar): add menu sidebar updating,"* **What kind of change does this PR introduce?** (Bug fix, feature, docs update, ...)

A new feature - sidebar menu entries updating.

* **What is the current behavior?** (You can also link to an open issue here)

The sidebar menu is loaded at the beginning when _baSidebar.component_ is instantiated and remains unchanged since. It is also very hard to update it afterward.

* **What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**

_baMenu.service_ is exposed to the application and via `updateMenuByRoutes`, which takes in the object of the type similar to _app.menu.ts_(essentially how the menu is structured), allows easy sidebar menu updating.

* **Other information**:

I believe this change does no harm and only provides benefits, as this feature was requested by a few people in issue #236.
If you have any questions, opinions or suggestions I would be happy to hear them.

To use this in a component/service of yours simply import `baMenu.service` from the _theme_ directory, inject it into the constructor of your component/service and use the `updateMenuByRoutes` method when the menu needs to be modified. You don't have to clone your menu, it will remain unchanged, opposed to the default behavior or _baMenu.service_ methods that mutate their inputs.

To test if this works you can modify the `constructor` of the _baMenu.service_:
``` typescript
  constructor(private _router:Router) {
    this.updateMenuByRoutes(<Routes>MENU);

    setInterval(() => {
      let menuPart = _.cloneDeep(MENU);
      menuPart[0].children = menuPart[0].children.filter(() => Math.random() > 0.5);
      console.log('Updating routes', menuPart);
      this.updateMenuByRoutes(<Routes>menuPart);
    }, 4000);
  }
```
Every 4 seconds the menu will be updated, items that should remain will be chosen randomly.",548.0,https://api.github.com/repos/akveo/ngx-admin/pulls/548,https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin/pull/548,closed,42.0,19.0,9.0,3.0,18.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,[],2016-12-17 13:37:57,2016-12-20 08:22:58,[],Grzegorz Rozdzialik,889383.0,voreny.gelio@gmail.com,User,148.0,,12.0,40.0

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of node-sass.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of rxjs.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

This version is **covered** by your **current version range** and after updating it in your project **the build went from success to failure**.

As postcss-loader is a direct dependency of this project **this is very likely breaking your project right now**. If other packages depend on you it’s very likely also breaking them.
I recommend you give this issue a very high priority. I’m sure you can resolve this :muscle:


Of course this could just be a false positive, caused by a flaky test suite, or third parties that are currently broken or unavailable, but that would be another problem I’d recommend working on.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-bootstrap.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of node-sass.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-bootstrap.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of tslint.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-merge.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-dev-server.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

<ul>
<li>Add new fancy error overlay in-browser, which shows up when there are compilation errors.

<li>If you use <code>--open</code> and <code>options.public</code>, the browser will now open the same URL as you have defined in <code>public</code> (<a href=""https://urls.greenkeeper.io/webpack/webpack-dev-server/pull/749"" class=""issue-link js-issue-link"" data-url=""https://github.com/webpack/webpack-dev-server/issues/749"" data-id=""201519152"" data-error-text=""Failed to load issue title"" data-permission-text=""Issue title is private"">#749</a>).</li>

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.

**It looks like your project, in its current form, is malfunctioning** and this update didn’t really change that. I don’t want to leave you in the dark about updates though. I recommend you get your project passing and then check the impact of this update again.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of sass-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

[GitHub Release](https://github.com/chartjs/Chart.js/releases/tag/v2.5.0)

<p>Version 2.5 brings some exciting new features to Chart.js. Now, configuration options can be updated at runtime (with some exceptions) just by changing the <code>chart.config.options</code> object and calling <code>chart.update()</code>.</p>
<p><a href=""https://chartjs.gitbooks.io/proposals/content/Plugins.html"">More powerful plugins</a> that can be added to an individual chart (instead of globally), but also <a href=""https://chartjs.gitbooks.io/proposals/content/Plugins.html#disable-plugins"">disabled on a per chart basis</a>. This gives you fine grained control over when plugins interact with your charts. The plugins were changed to support cancelling chart actions by returning <code>false</code> from any <code>before*</code> plugin calls.</p>
<p>Two new extensions have been added: <code>beforeEvent</code> and <code>afterEvent</code>, respectively called before and after the chart responds to an input event such as a <code>mousemove</code> or a <code>click</code>. The plugin is passed a wrapped version of the event, that implements <a href=""https://chartjs.gitbooks.io/proposals/content/Platform.html#event-management""><code>IEvent</code></a>.</p>

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of script-ext-html-webpack-plugin.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-completer.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of fullcalendar.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of awesome-typescript-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ngx-uploader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of rimraf.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of sass-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of awesome-typescript-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of postcss-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of css-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of imports-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of resolve-url-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of electron.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of css-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of css-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of style-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of style-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

The current arrow in the dropdown menu is a list item. That's visible on hover in the dropdown though.

The new behavior shows the arrow on the top of the dropdown but doesn't have the extra space and empty list item that is visible on hover.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-bootstrap.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-completer.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of node-sass.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of style-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of fullcalendar.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of string-replace-loader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-bootstrap.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-bootstrap.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of codelyzer.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of rxjs.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-completer.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ngc-webpack.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of electron.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ng2-smart-table.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

<h1>Security fix:</h1>
<p>This version contains a security fix, which is also breaking change if you have an insecure configuration.<br>
We are releasing this breaking change as patch version to protect you from attacks.<br>
Sorry if this breaks your setup, but the fix is easy.</p>
<p>We added a check for the correct <code>Host</code> header to the webpack-dev-server.<br>
This allowed evil websites to access your assets.</p>
<p>The <code>Host</code> header of the request have to match the listening adress or the host provided in the <code>public</code> option.<br>
Make sure to provide correct values here.</p>
<p>The response will contain a note when using an incorrect <code>Host</code> header.</p>
<p>For usage behind a Proxy or similar setups we also added a <code>disableHostCheck</code> option to disable this check.<br>
Only use it when you know what you do. Not recommended.</p>
<h1>Bugfixes:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Requests are not blocked when <code>Host</code> doesn't match listening host or <code>public</code> option.</li>
<li>Requests to <code>localhost</code> or <code>127.0.0.1</code> are not blocked.</li>
</ul>
<h1>Features:</h1>
<ul>
<li>Added <code>disableHostCheck</code> option to disable the host check</li>

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of add-asset-html-webpack-plugin.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of webpack-dev-server.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of typescript.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ngx-uploader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

This version is **not covered** by your **current version range**.

Without accepting this pull request your project will work just like it did before. There might be a bunch of new features, fixes and perf improvements that the maintainers worked on for you though.

I recommend you look into these changes and try to get onto the latest version of ngx-uploader.
Given that you have a decent test suite, a passing build is a strong indicator that you can take advantage of these changes by merging the proposed change into your project. Otherwise this branch is a great starting point for you to work on the update.


Do you have any ideas how I could improve these pull requests? Did I report anything you think isn’t right?
Are you unsure about how things are supposed to work?

There is a collection of [frequently asked questions](https://greenkeeper.io/faq.html) and while I’m just a bot, there is a group of people who are happy to teach me new things. [Let them know](https://github.com/greenkeeperio/greenkeeper/issues/new).

Good luck with your project :sparkles:

You rock!

507,118312099.0,Update dependencies to enable Greenkeeper 🌴,"
Let’s get started with automated dependency management for ng2-admin :muscle:

This pull request **updates all your dependencies to their latest version**. Having them all up to date really is the best starting point. I will look out for further dependency updates and make sure to handle them in isolation and in real-time, **as soon as you merge this pull request**.

**I won’t start sending you further updates, unless you have merged this very pull request**.

<details>
<summary>💥 This branch failed. How to proceed</summary>
I suggest you find out what dependency update is causing the problem. Adapt your code so things are working nicely together again. [next-update](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-update) is a really handy tool to help you with this.

Push the changes to this branch and merge it.

<summary>🙈 How to ignore certain dependencies</summary>

In case you can not, or do not want to update a certain dependency right now, you can of course just [change the `package.json` file back to your liking](https://github.com/akveo/ng2-admin/edit/greenkeeper/initial/package.json).

Add a `greenkeeper.ignore` field to your `package.json`, containing a list of dependencies you don’t want to update right now.

```js
// package.json
{
  …
  ""greenkeeper"": {
    ""ignore"": [
      ""package-names"",
      ""you-want-me-to-ignore""
    ]
  }
}
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>👩‍💻 How to update this pull request</summary>

```bash
  # change into your repository’s directory
  git fetch
  git checkout greenkeeper/initial
  npm install-test
  # adapt your code, so it’s working again
  git commit -m 'chore: adapt code to updated dependencies'
  git push origin greenkeeper/initial
```
</details>
<details>
<summary>✨ How the updates will look like</summary>

As soon as you merge this pull request **I’ll create a branch for every dependency update**, with the new version applied. The branch creation should trigger your testing services to check the new version. Using the results of these tests I’ll try to open meaningful and helpful pull requests and issues, so your dependencies remain working and up-to-date.

```diff
-  ""underscore"": ""^1.6.0""
+  ""underscore"": ""^1.7.0""
```

In the above example you can see an in-range update. `1.7.0` is included in the old `^1.6.0` range, because of the [caret `^` character ](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/semver#ranges).
When the test services report success I’ll delete the branch again, because no action needs to be taken – everything is fine.
When there is a failure however, I’ll create an issue so you know about the problem immediately.

This way every single version update of your dependencies will either continue to work with your project, or you’ll get to know of potential problems immediately.

```diff
-  ""lodash"": ""^3.0.0""
+  ""lodash"": ""^4.0.0""
```

In this example the new version `4.0.0` is not included in the old `^3.0.0` range.
For version updates like these – let’s call them “out of range” updates – you’ll receive a pull request.

Now **you no longer need to check for exciting new versions by hand** – I’ll just let you know automatically.
And the pull request will not only serve as a reminder to update. In case it passes your decent test suite that’s a strong reason to merge right away :shipit:

**What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**
the suggested changes allow using html5 routing with PathLocationStrategy (e.g. http://localhost:4200/pages/ui-features/buttons)
this is enabled with ng serve, even after page refresh

**Other information:**
changed `useHash` to `false` in app-routing.module.ts
and added `<base href=""/"">` in index.html

**Note:**
for this to work, the web server should be configured to redirect all requests to index.html

Feature

**What is the current behavior?** 
During navigation, there is no indicator that a network request is being made e.g API call or lazy loaded module. The user may think the app is not responding.

**What is the new behavior (if this is a feature change)?**
This is a an automatic loading progress bar and spinner using [pace.js](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/).
It works out of the box without the need for any manual configurations.
It automatically shows a loading progress indicator when a network request is made, without the need to explicitly call any code.

**Other information:**
`pace.min.js` and `pace-theme-flash.scss` are placed in `/assets/vendors/pace/` and added to `.angular-cli.json` to be loaded by angular.
the color of the indicator is set in `pace-theme-flash.scss` using the theme variable `nb-theme(color-fg-highlight)`

refer to [pace.js documentation](http://github.hubspot.com/pace/) for advanced configurations.

About this issue : https://github.com/akveo/ngx-admin/issues/1521

In the header, the change detection was not working automatically because change detection value was ""ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush"" in app and pages.

So I removed ChangeDetectionStrategy.OnPush in app.component and pages.component.
Now, the change detection values are ""ChangeDetectionStrategy.Default"".

Redirects users who hit an unknown page to a custom component
Fixes #1410

A couple of things I was not too sure about : 
- I've designed it so that only errors within /pages/* are captured by this. I think that for most single page applications, you probably don't want to catch 404's in a global manner (it's ambiguous if the user is not authenticated). I expect most people to have protected their pages directory with a guard of some sort.
-  Should this component be within nebular?
- Should we have a direct link in the demo menu to show this page?
